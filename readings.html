<h3>Reading #1: Susan Sontag’s "On Photography"</h3>
</b>

<b>
<p>What does it mean to you to capture images and create graphics?</p>
</b>

<p>“While real people are out there killing themselves or other real people, the photographer stays behind his or her camera, creating a tiny element of another world: the image-world that bids to outlast us all”.</p>
<p> Escapism is a prevalent and undeniable theme across different mediums. Addiction, Sex, Work, food, all components of indulgence. In the context of the identity of the voyeur, photographers mimic the indulgence of gazing. To me photography is the act of capturing, like Sontag mentioned, Idealized worlds. I even consider it cowardice presented as the act of documentation. Physically the act of placing an object that allows to create distance from subjects and events feels like curling shyly around a door frame. I really adore the way Sontag’s touched upon this uncanny existence of capturing an idealized mirror of reality. My camera is a tool that allows me to capture something I find beautiful, interesting, horrific, appealing, desirable, without consequence. When creating my work I ask myself, “If you found a pocket of time that felt so surreal and tangible, what would you find?”. Finding moments such as these feel so fragile and feeble, that the only way to know it was real is to capture it. The shutter cements a single frame of a second of time into a tangible feeling. I spend my time curating worlds in photoshop and lightroom curating an image to what I am delirious to think I actually saw. Residing in a romanticized actuality that does not exist. Yet I indulge in it anyway. I seek out to create idealized worlds and moments, hyperfocusing on the dopamine rushes of beauty and unseen worlds. Photography makes me feel whole even in my own strange form of cowardice. I would rather exist in my own heady romanticized daze than actually engage in the real world. I view indulgence as a double edged sword while being aware of its consequences and positives. To me, creating this art helps aid the chaos all humans are collectively born with. The image-world feels the most immovable and so close to reality that it is almost possible. Art has always existed in this fascinating strange grey-area, as subjectivity rules how we understand it.  Capturing moments in that ambiguity gives you the autonomy to not be definitive. Nowadays on the internet we become immediately defined by what we choose to post, comment on, like, or reshare. These acts are all intentional, all hurdling towards an end goal be seen by others. We do not have control over how we are perceived but we do have choice in what we want to capture behind our lens. I believe we are shown so many instances of how cruel the real world is that I think hiding behind the lens could be healing. Photographers are given the choice to intervene and capture aspects of its horrors or find tranquility in its beauty. I’ve chosen to dedicate my life to craft that allows me to shape my life, the worlds, and the events I want to capture. It’s selfish and it’s almost hard to admit how badly I always want to feel like I'm somewhere else. To live in the caught breath of awe. To place my confidence in cowardice. Even if it is warped, as Sontag put it, defense against anxiety.</P>
